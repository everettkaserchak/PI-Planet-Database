# PI Planet Database
  **Polaris Industries Space Pioneers Planet Database** is one of Polaris Industries' major projects. It stores data and information about planets across the Space Pioneers universe.
Below is an example of the stored .json files for each planet:
```json
{
  "id": "3908-1",
  "name": "Indra",
  "notes": "Settlement",
  "atmos": "Martian"
  "terra": "Continental"
  "salt": "True",
  "lime": "True",
  "quartz": "True",
  [an so on...]
}
```
